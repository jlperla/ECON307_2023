## Grading
This material is best learned by doing exercises.  When appropriate, we will review some of the problem set answers in class.
- 4-6 problem sets: 20%
- Midterm: 30%
- Final Exam: 50%

Assume that all grades will be curved (weakly up for exams).

Exams are long but fair.  You will be allowed a cheat-sheet.

Assignments are to be submitted electronically in whatever method the TA establishes.

**Missed Exam Policy:** You are responsible for ensuring that you take these exams as scheduled; no make-up exams will be given.
- Missing a midterm for ANY acceptable reason will result in its weight being automatically transferred to the final exam.
- The final exam date will be announced by Student Services about half-way through the term.
- There is no make-up final. Travel plans and/or cheap tickets are not a reason to miss the final. If you have a medical	or other compelling reason why you cannot take the final exam at its scheduled time you must follow the formal process and get an Academic Concession from your Faculty Advising Office (see below)

**Policy for Academic Concessions:**
Sometimes, things happen during the course of a semester that can affect your ability to succeed.  There are three main categories:
- Medical – i.e. you got sick and missed class or a chronic illness got worse
- Compassionate – i.e. a friend or close relative had something bad happen to them, or something bad happened to you.
- Conflicting Responsibilities – i.e. something happened in your personal life which is affecting your ability to do the work, like childcare falling through
You can read more about specific examples and the whole policy at:
http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0

In all of these cases, UBC’s policy is to allow you to request an academic concession.  My policy is that all requests for academic concession on exams should be handled through your faculty Advising office (unless your office advises otherwise).  This is so that we can centrally track requests for concession and ensure they are fairly administered; it also helps protect your privacy.  You can find the procedure here, for Arts:

https://students.arts.ubc.ca/advising/academic-performance/help-academic-concession/

If you need a concession, you should immediately speak to Advising, who will follow-up with me to handle the academic side of things.  In-term concessions, which handle things like missed assignments or deadlines, are handled usually by extending the deadline or adjusting the final grading of the course (e.g. omitting an assessment).  Alternative forms of assessment may also be used if suitable and recommended by Advising.
•	Concessions need to be made in a timely fashion, which I will define as “within 2 weeks of the missed assessment” unless this is not reasonable.
You are also welcome to speak to me regarding your issue; I’m here to support you and help you get through things and be successful.  If you’re not sure if it’s something you should/could get a concession for, I can also give you a quick sense of what Advising will likely suggest if you’re unable to make an appointment immediately.

## Policies

**Academic Integrity**
It is the policy of the VSE to report all violations of UBC’s standards for academic
honesty to the office of the Dean of Arts. A detailed description of academic integrity,
including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the UBC Calendar:
Student Conduct and Discipline. In addition to the violations stated on that page (for
example, plagiarism), the VSE rules state that any student who hires a tutor/editor to help
with any portion of their work will be given an automatic grade of zero on their submitted
work. Any student found to have violated the university rules on academic misconduct
will receive a grade of zero on the relevant work. Further penalties, may be levied by the
President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Those further penalties could
include a notation on your transcript indicating that you have committed an academic
offence, failure of the course, and/or suspension from the university.

**Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities**
The University of British Columbia recognizes its moral and legal duty to provide
academic accommodation. The University must remove barriers and provide
opportunities to students with a disability, enabling them to access university services,
programs, and facilities and to be welcomed as participating members of the University
community. The University’s goal is to ensure fair and consistent treatment of all
students, including students with a disability, in accordance with their distinct needs and
in a manner consistent with academic principles. The University will provide academic
accommodation to students with disabilities in accordance with the British Columbia
Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210 and the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982
(U.K.), 1982, c. 11. Provision of academic accommodation shall not lower the academic
standards of the University. Academic accommodation shall not remove the need for
evaluation and the need to meet essential learning outcomes. Students with a disability
who wish to have an academic accommodation should contact Centre for Accessibility
without delay (see UBC Policy 73).

**Conflicting Responsibilities**
UBC recognizes that students may occasionally have conflicting responsibilities that
affect their ability to attend class or examinations. These may include: representing the
University, the province or the country in a competition or performance; serving in the
Canadian military; or observing a religious rite. They may also include a change in a
student’s situation that unexpectedly requires that student to work or take responsibility
for the care of a family member, if these were not pre-existing situations at the start of
term.

Students with conflicting responsibilities have a duty to arrange their course schedules to
avoid, as much as possible, any conflicts with course requirements. As soon as
conflicting responsibilities arise, students must notify either their instructor(s) or their
Faculty Advising Office (e.g. Arts Academic Advising), and can request academic
concession. Instructors may not be able to comply with all such requests if the academic
standards and integrity of the course or program would be compromised.

Varsity student-athletes should discuss any anticipated and unavoidable regular-season
absences with the instructor at the start of term and provide notice of playoff or
championship absences in writing as soon as dates are confirmed.
Religious observance may preclude attending classes or examinations at certain times. In
accordance with the UBC Policy on Religious Holidays, students who wish to be
accommodated for religious reasons must notify their instructors in writing at least two
weeks in advance. Instructors provide opportunity for such students to make up work or
examinations missed without penalty.


**Policies and Resources to Support Student Success**
UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but
recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access
including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and
ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not
tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate
accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances.
UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas
generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all their actions.
Details of the policies and how to access support are available here

**Statement regarding academic freedom**
During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0 for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.
